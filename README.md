# Enhanced Contact Us System

This project aims to develop a user-friendly and efficient "Contact Us" system, providing multiple channels for users to connect with you. The system will encompass the following core functions:

**1. Homepage Integration:**
- A Contact Us button on the homepage through which clients and customers do a Quick Enquiry by filling in essential fields (e.g. email, phone, message).
- This streamlines the process for users who don't require a detailed message.

**2. Dedicated Contact Us Page:**
- Creating a separate "Contact Us" page with fields like Name, Email, Phone Number, Topic Selection Dropdown, and Message Box.
- Providing a Privacy statement outlining how user's information will be collected, used, and stored. This builds trust and transparency with users.
  
**3. Data Storage and Retrieval:**
- Building a secure Database using MongoDB to store the user contact information and query details.
  
**4. User Experience:**
- Building a User-Friendly Contact form with clear labels, error messages, and placeholders.
- Adding Data validation to prevent spam/invalid data submission.
- Integrating form with CAPTCHA or other anti-spam mechanism to discourage auto-spam submission.
- Providing user confirmation message upon successful form submission.
